   &diamond; fully interoperable with DateTime, Date, Time types    
   &diamond; provides a clean, easy-to-understand functional interface

>  The 2018 US, EU financial regulations governing timestamps require stamped times encode UTC Â±50 microseconds.
This package does not know whether a conforming time server is present.  The timestamps will be precise; where the time base is UTC traceable and stable,  the timestamps will comply with FINRA and MiFID II 2018 regulations.
